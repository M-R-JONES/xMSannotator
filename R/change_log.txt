Change log:

- added faahKO processing with xcms and CAMERA packages to generate model data for workflow testing
- added missing value filling through permuting random selection of variables from uniform distribution
- updated section involving comparisons to user-defined database - simplified the if/else structure
- HMDB query section simplified
- import the customDB as a dataframe without the need for further conversions between character and numeric
- the water adduct check is wrong as it does not add on / subtract the number of water "adducts" from the formula
- in the region in which time neighbours is calculated, added -1 to account for the fact the peak should not be added to the calculation (overall it won't change anything, as all peaks are treated equally, i.e. all have +1 too many neighbours indicated)
